# DevOps + AI Demo

<!-- Title and brief description -->
This project demonstrates how AI (OpenAI) can automate DevOps workflows. You describe what infrastructure you want in plain English, and GitHub Actions + OpenAI generate and apply Terraform code automatically.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

<!-- Summary of the AI-driven automation pipeline -->
1. You commit a plain text instruction to this repository, for example:

2. The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered and does the following:
- Reads your natural language instruction
- Sends it to OpenAI using a shell script (`scripts/call_openai.sh`)
- Receives Terraform code generated by OpenAI
- Writes the code to `infra/staging/main.tf`
- Initializes and applies the Terraform code with `terraform init` and `terraform apply`
