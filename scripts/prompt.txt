Generate a valid Terraform configuration using the kreuzwerker/docker provider. The configuration should:

    Initialize the docker provider using:

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        docker = {
          source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
          version = "~> 3.0.2"
        }
      }
    }

    Create a Docker network named "app-network".

    Define a Docker container named "nginx" that:

        Uses the "nginx:latest" image

        Connects to the "app-network"

        Maps container port 80 to host port 8180

        Uses the correct ports block structure

        Uses the correct networks_advanced block to attach to the network

        Uses depends_on referencing the full docker_network.app-network resource (not .id)

    Define a Docker container named "flask_app" that:

        Uses the "tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.8" image

        Mounts the host folder ${path.module}/app into /app in the container

        Connects to the "app-network"

        Maps container port 5000 to host port 8100

        Uses the correct mounts block for the volume mount (not volumes)

        Uses the correct ports and networks_advanced block structures

        Uses depends_on referencing the full docker_network.app-network resource (not .id)

All references must use correct Terraform HCL syntax, avoid .id in depends_on, and ensure absolute paths (e.g., ${path.module}/app) are used for mounting the local directory.
