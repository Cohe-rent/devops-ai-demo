Generate a complete Terraform main.tf file using the kreuzwerker/docker provider. The configuration must:

    Use provider docker (compatible with local Docker engine).

    Create a Docker network named app-network.

    Create two Docker containers:

a. Nginx container:

    Name: nginx

    Image: nginx:latest

    Connect to app-network

    Expose port 80 in the container and map it to port 8180 on the host

b. Flask app container:

    Name: flask_app

    Image: tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.8

    Connect to app-network

    Expose port 5000 in the container and map it to port 8100 on the host

    Mount a volume from the host machine's path ${abspath(path.module)}/app to /app inside the container

    Use only correct arguments supported by docker_container, like:

    name

    image

    ports block with internal and external keys

    volumes block with host_path and container_path

    networks_advanced block with name and aliases

Ensure that all volume paths are absolute using ${abspath(path.module)}.

The Terraform code must be syntactically valid and ready to run with terraform init, plan, and apply.
