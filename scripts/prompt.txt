Generate a valid Terraform configuration that runs locally using the Docker provider. The setup should include:

- A frontend container running NGINX and exposing port 80
- A backend container running a Python Flask app and exposing port 5000
- Both containers should be defined using the Docker provider
- Use a Docker bridge network so both containers can communicate
- The Terraform configuration must use a correct `terraform {}` block with required providers
- No cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP) should be used
- Backend storage should not be defined or should use `local` backend inside the `terraform` block
- The code should be fully working and `terraform init` and `terraform apply` should succeed without errors
