Generate a complete Terraform configuration to deploy a simple local environment using Docker. The setup should include:

1. An Nginx container to serve as the frontend.
2. A Python (Flask) backend container.
3. Use `terraform` with `docker` provider.
4. Nginx should reverse proxy to the Python app running on port 5000.
5. Set up a `docker_network` so both containers can communicate.
6. Expose Nginx on localhost:8080.

Only return the complete Terraform code inside a code block.
